Introducing Radar
Radar is an electromagnetic sensor used to track, locate, and identify various
objects from long distances. Radar may be able to determine the size and
shape of these objects as well. Its working principle depends on transmitting
electromagnetic energy towards specific targets, and monitoring the echoes
returning from them. These may be The targets are planes, ships, spacecraft,
cars, or even birds. Radar devices are distinguished from optical sensors and
infrared devices in their ability to accurately detect distant objects even in the
presence of difficult weather conditions. Doppler radar is a radar that
specializes in determining the speed of objects, and its working principle is
based on the knowledge that the waves produced by the body will gather
when the individual or device approaches it, and will spread when it moves
away from it, such as the radar used to monitor the speed of cars.
Types of radar devices
There are several types of radar devices that differ according to their use,
including the following: Marine radar devices are used to determine the
direction of ships and the distance between them to avoid collisions, and
to determine their locations at sea based on fixed references such as
islands. Aerial radar devices, aircraft are equipped with radar devices, in
order to avoid obstructing their path, and to accurately determine air
altitude readings. Radar devices in missile guidance systems, used in
military aircraft to determine missile destinations. Radar devices in
biological research, such as those used to track the migration patterns of
animals and birds. Weather radars are used to increase the accuracy of
forecasting the weather.
)ECHO
Echo is a phenomenon you experience every day. If you shout in a well or
narrow valley, you will hear the echo after a few moments. The echo occurs
because your sound waves will reflect off the opposite surface (even if the
surface of the water is below the well or on the other side of the valley) and
bounce directly back to your ears, and the time between the moment you
utter the cry and the moment you hear the echo depends on the distance
between you and the surface on which the sound wave was reflected
causing echo.We've seen how we can use echoes to determine how far an object is from us, and
how we can use the Doppler shift to determine how fast an object is moving. Now
we can make sound radar, and this is the principle of sonar. Submarines and ships
always use sonar. You can use the same audio features in the air, but this will cause
several problems:
• Sound does not travel very far, maybe 1 mile (1.6 km) at most.
• Since anyone can hear the sounds, the sonic radar will inevitably disturb the
neighbors (this problem can be overcome by using ultrasonic waves instead of
audible sound waves).
• The poor efficiency of the echo of sound waves will make it difficult to monitor it
That is why radar uses radio waves, not sound waves. Radio waves are very fast,
invisible to humans, and easy to detect, even if they are weak.
Let's now study a typical radar designed specifically to monitor aircraft in flight. This
radar operates its transmitter to emit a short, high-intensity string of radio waves,
lasting only microseconds, then the radar turns off the transmitter, turns on the
receiver, which records the echo of the emitted waves, and measures the time it
took for the echo and its Doppler shift
